<p>Quip! It’s where creation and communication smash together to become collaboration. How does that happen?</p>
<p>Well, every Quip document has two channels for talking to your collaborators: individual  <strong>comment</strong>  threads, and the overall  <strong>document conversation.</strong></p>
<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
<p>Comments are designed for talking about specific parts of a document, spreadsheet, or slide deck. In general, you can just…</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the thing you want to talk about.</li>
<li>Look for the comment button. Click it.</li>
<li>Leave a comment!</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re into shortcuts, you can hit command-shift-C (Mac) or ctrl-shift-C (PC) instead of clicking the comment button.</p>
<p>The comment button looks like this, by the way:<br>
<img src="https://www.quipsupport.com/hc/article_attachments/360017545732/blobid0.png" alt="image.png">  .</p>
<h3 id="commenting-in-documents">Commenting in documents</h3>
<p>You can comment on any of the following by simply clicking on it, then clicking the comment bubble that appears to its left:</p>
<ul>
<li>A paragraph</li>
<li>A header</li>
<li>A list item</li>
<li>An image</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.quipsupport.com/hc/article_attachments/360017545892/leavecomment.gif" alt="leavecomment.gif"></p>
<p>You can also get more granular, and comment on specific parts of the elements above.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Text:</strong>  To comment on a particular bit of text within a larger text block, just select it, then click the comment bubble in the controls that pop up.</li>
<li><strong>Images:</strong>  To comment on a specific part of an image, click the image, then click the comment bubble in the controls that pop up. Look, now a little yellow dot is attached to your cursor. Drop it on whichever part of the image you want to talk about.</li>
<li><strong>Live Apps:</strong>  Lots of elements within Live Apps can be commented on. Just keep your eyes peeled for the little comment bubble when you’re clicking around.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="commenting-in-spreadsheets">Commenting in spreadsheets</h3>
<p>You can comment on any cell in a spreadsheet, no matter what data that cell contains. Text, numbers, images, it’s all fair game. You can even comment on an empty cell, but we’re not sure why you’d want to.</p>
<p>To leave a comment, just…</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the cell you want to comment on.</li>
<li>Click the comment button in the top right corner.</li>
<li>Leave a comment!</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can hit command-shift-C (Mac) or ctrl-shift-C (PC) instead of clicking the comment button. You can also right click on a cell, then select “Comment” from the dropdown menu.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that you  <em>can’t</em>  comment on whole rows, columns, or other ranges of cells.</p>
<h3 id="commenting-in-slides">Commenting in slides</h3>
<p>You can comment on an entire slide, or you can attach a comment to any particular item on a slide—a text box, an image, a chart, a poll, etc. Even better, you can attach it to  <em>any particular part</em>  of that item. A specific part of an image. A particularly tall bar in a chart. Think of it as the online equivalent of pointing to stuff.</p>
<p><strong>To add a comment to a slide:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Click the comment button. At little yellow comment-colored dot will get attached to your cursor.</li>
<li>Click on whatever part of the slide you want to talk about.</li>
<li>Leave a comment.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.quipsupport.com/hc/article_attachments/360017430071/slides.gif" alt="slides.gif"></p>
<p>Once you’ve placed your comment, you can move it if you need to. Just drag the yellow comment bubble to wherever you want it to go.</p>
<h3 id="who-gets-notified-when-you-leave-a-comment">Who gets notified when you leave a comment?</h3>
<p>Assuming they haven’t muted their notifications, these are the people who will be notified when you leave a comment:</p>
<ul>
<li>The person who authored the content you’re commenting on.</li>
<li>Anyone you @mention in the comment itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if you contribute to an existing comment thread, everyone participating in the thread will also be notified.</p>
<h3 id="responding-to-a-comment">Responding to a comment</h3>
<p>So, you’ve been mentioned in a comment! Congratulations. If you want to respond to it…</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the notification. You’ll be taken to wherever the comment is.</li>
<li>Type your response in the comment field. Easy.</li>
</ol>
<p>You don’t even have to respond by typing. You can also send emoji, Bitmoji, or just click the like button.</p>

<h2 id="the-document-conversation">The document conversation</h2>
<p>Every documents, spreadsheet, and slide deck has a document conversation built into it. It’s in a sidebar on the right, and it contains the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A history of every edit made to the document.</li>
<li>A history of every comment made on the document.</li>
<li>A record of when people join (and leave) the document.</li>
</ul>
<p>More pertinent to our purposes here, it also contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any messages people have posted to the sidebar itself.</li>
<li>And, at the very bottom, a field for writing and sending and messages to this sidebar.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://www.quipsupport.com/hc/article_attachments/360017545872/doc-convo.gif" alt="doc-convo.gif"></p>
<p>This is the document conversation. It’s good for discussing the document in general, rather than pointing to any specific part of it. Want someone to review what you’ve created? Just @mention them here in the document conversation and let ’em know what they’re looking at. Debating how the content you’ve written should fit into your company’s overall content strategy? This is the perfect forum.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you’re debating the particulars of a certain section of a document, or asking about a particular cell in a spreadsheet, individual comments are your friends.</p>
<p>Basically, if you need to point to something, use a comment. If you don’t, use the conversation pane.</p>
<h2 id="mentions-in-comments-and-conversation">@Mentions in comments and conversation</h2>
<p>Yep, your trusty @ key still has plenty of powers in comments and conversations. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can @mention a person (or multiple people) to send them a notification about the comment you’re leaving.</li>
<li>You can @mention a document or folder to create a quick link to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Small things, but they really speed up your work. No need to hunt down those URLs, ya know?</p>
<h2 id="editing-comments-and-messages">Editing comments and messages</h2>
<p>Make a typo? Paste the wrong link? No problem. Just hover over the message or comment you want to edit, click the edit button, fix your mistake, then click the check mark to save.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.quipsupport.com/hc/article_attachments/360019869551/edit.gif" alt="edit.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Shortcut:</strong>  If the message you want to edit is the last message you sent, just hit the up arrow. You’ll go straight into editing mode.</p>
